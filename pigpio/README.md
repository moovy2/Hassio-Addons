# ðŸš¨ Addons are moved ðŸšš

__I moved my addons to a own organisation for easier maintaining and maybe allowing contributers to maintain one addon as well. Please switch to the new repository to get future updates.__

The new home of my addons is: https://github.com/Poeschl-HomeAssistant-Addons/repository

A migration guide is available here: [migrate_from_Poeschl_repository.md](https://github.com/Poeschl-HomeAssistant-Addons/repository/docs/migrate_from_Poeschl_repository.md)

## Usage

This addon runs the pigpio deamon which listens on http commands and control the GPIO on a Raspberry Pi accordingly.
Running this and using the [remote_rpi_pgio integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/remote_rpi_gpio/) in your Home Assistant configuration pointing to `localhost` will connect both worlds.

For additional options for the deamon use the optional addon setting `additional_options`.
The options`-g -f` will be always set!

## Security

It accesses `/dev/mem` on the host and also has full access to the raw io data.
