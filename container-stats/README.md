# üö® Addons are moved üöö

__I moved my addons to a own organisation for easier maintaining and maybe allowing contributers to maintain one addon as well. Please switch to the new repository to get future updates.__

The new home of my addons is: https://github.com/Poeschl-HomeAssistant-Addons/repository

A migration guide is available here: [migrate_from_Poeschl_repository.md](https://github.com/Poeschl-HomeAssistant-Addons/repository/docs/migrate_from_Poeschl_repository.md)

## üß™ Experimental Addon

During long-term usage I noticed that the addon fills up all available memory when getting the data for a week.
Especially on a Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant this means death in a few minutes.
__Use this addon on your own risk!__

## Security

Since the addon accesses the docker api, the security rating is this low.
Unfortunately there is now way to access the docker api without disabling the *Protection Mode* of the addon.
Technically with disabling it, the addon can access and control other addons and the core on a HA supervised system.
But without it we can not retrieve the statistics of the running container and this addon don't work at all.
